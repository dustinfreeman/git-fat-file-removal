Please enjoy this text file of darkness. A hellmouth of absolute pain, the text in this file should feel you with horrific feelings of wonderous self-doubt, nothing, and fickle navel-gazing.

While this text file is not bespoke, you may think of it as casually tossed in your direction. Or whatever.

This is an edited sentence that appeared randomly. And then another appeared. The reader was concerned for some times - was his/her/their saccades broken, so that each. new. word. from the ever-approaching right side was a surprise. What a terrifying future-agnostic existence!

This text file should be treated not as a service, but merely provided as-is [1], with no warranty or guarantees that the feeling of horror/blessedness will be recieved, or be long-lasting.

AND THUS OUR TALE CONTINUES

At first, the text that we all lived in and ate was good, but at the boundaries of the text, where the articles became vaguer, there was talk that the author themselves was going mad. What was once a digression considered artful in other centuries was now considered a disrespectful use of the audiences' time. Text was no longer for slow consumption by the fireside in the countryside while staring out the window awaiting officers to return from war; it was instead for communicating information. So said some margin-scrambling reviewers.

[1] as of the latest commit, at any given time.
