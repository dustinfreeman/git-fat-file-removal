Please enjoy this text file of darkness. A hellmouth of absolute pain, the text in this file should feel you with horrific feelings of wonderous self-doubt, nothing, and fickle navel-gazing.

While this text file is not bespoke, you may think of it as casually tossed in your direction.

This is an edited sentence that appeared randomly. And then another appeared. The reader was concerned for some times - was his/her/their saccades broken, so that each. new. word. from the ever-approaching right side was a surprise. What a terrifying future-agnostic existence!

This text file should be treated not as a service, but merely provided as-is [1], with no warranty or guarantees that the feeling of horror/blessedness will be recieved, or be long-lasting.

[1] as of the latest commit, at any given time.
